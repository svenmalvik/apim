As a successful tech company, we have grown quickly. Through that growth, we have managed to go from a centralised management of API-M, to a setup where many teams take responsibility for their products, in a fast and effective way. Join us and see how we overcame this challenge, by setting up a complete API development lifecycle with Azure DevOps, Api-M and AKS. Everything in a secure and independent, DevOps-like way.
